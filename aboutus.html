        <h1>About us</h1>
        <p>An About Us page isn’t just where you share the story of your brand. It’s also where you tell your customer what you do for them and how you work to meet their needs in that area.

            It isn’t so much “Here’s what we’re about,” but more like “Here’s who we are, why we started, and what we can do for you.”
        </p>
        <p>As you’ll soon see, some businesses devote one or two short paragraphs to their About page – and that’s it. Others tell a long story of how they were founded, and yet more have multiple pages within their About page wheelhouse. 
        </p>
        <p>For example, if your brand is founded on strict environmental or ethical principles, you’ll probably spend more time explaining how you uphold those standards versus a brand that sells a simple, straightforward product.
